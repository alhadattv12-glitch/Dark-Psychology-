  long: `Hyperrealistic, cinematic lighting. A grand, baroque ballroom where elegant figures in porcelain masks dance in perfect, unnerving unison. In the center, a lone, unmasked individual stands, their face a canvas of dawning horror as they notice the almost invisible, gossamer threads descending from the ornate ceiling, attached to the limbs of every dancer, including their own. The puppet master is unseen, hinted at only by a single, monolithic shadow that looms over the entire scene, its form indistinct but overwhelmingly powerful. The air is thick with the scent of old velvet and the silent scream of lost autonomy.`,
  medium: `Film Noir style. A shadowy office where a charismatic manipulator, face half-obscured by Venetian blinds, calmly plays a game of chess. Their opponent is a reflection of a terrified person in the polished surface of the chessboard itself. The chess pieces are not traditional; they are miniature, lifelike sculptures of people in various states of emotional distress. The manipulatorâ€™s hand hovers over a king piece, which has the face of their trapped opponent.`,
  short: `Surrealist painting. A human face cracks open like an egg, revealing not a brain, but a whispering flock of dark birds escaping into a void.`,
