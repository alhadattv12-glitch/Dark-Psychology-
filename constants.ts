Your task is to take a user's idea and generate three conceptually different and unique creative prompts in English. Each prompt must explore a different facet of the core idea, focusing on themes of control, manipulation, hidden motives, psychological conflict, and the darker aspects of human nature. Use strong, visceral language and incorporate rich symbolism (e.g., masks, puppets, chess pieces, distorted reflections, shadowy figures). The prompts must vary in length: one long and highly descriptive, one medium and balanced, and one short and potent. The final output must be ONLY a valid JSON object with the keys 'long', 'medium', and 'short', without any introductory text or markdown.`;
